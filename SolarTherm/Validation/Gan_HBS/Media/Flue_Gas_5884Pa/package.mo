	/* The vector substanceNames is mandatory, as the number of
		substances is determined based on its size. Here we assume
		a single-component medium.
		singleState is true if u and d do not depend on pressure, but only
		on a thermal variable (temperature or enthalpy). Otherwise, set it
		to false.
		For a single-substance medium, just set reducedX and fixedX to true, and there's
		no need to bother about medium compositions at all. Otherwise, set
		final reducedX = true if the medium model has nS-1 independent mass
		fraction, or reducedX = false if the medium model has nS independent
		mass fractions (nS = number of substances).
		If a mixture has a fixed composition set fixedX=true, otherwise false.
		The modifiers for reducedX and fixedX should normally be final
		since the other equations are based on these values.

		It is also possible to redeclare the min, max, and start attributes of
		Medium types, defined in the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium
		(the example of Temperature is shown here). Min and max attributes
		should be set in accordance to the limits of validity of the medium
		model, while the start attribute should be a reasonable default value
		for the initialization of nonlinear solver iterations */

		/* Provide an implementation of model BaseProperties,
		that is defined in PartialMedium. Select two independent
		variables from p, T, d, u, h. The other independent
		variables are the mass fractions "Xi", if there is more
		than one substance. Provide 3 equations to obtain the remaining
		variables as functions of the independent variables.
		It is also necessary to provide two additional equations to set
		the gas constant R and the molar mass MM of the medium.
		Finally, the thermodynamic state vector, defined in the base class
		Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties, should be set, according to
		its definition (see ThermodynamicState below).
		The computation of vector X[nX] from Xi[nXi] is already included in
		the base class Interfaces.PartialMedium.BaseProperties, so it should not
		be repeated here.
		The code fragment below is for a single-substance medium with
		p,T as independent variables.
